## Scenario  <a name= "scenario"></a>

Version 1
You can input x's and o's into a board, setting specifical places.
It will tell you when it is full, and the game is hence over.
It assumes people will not overwrite a square, and that the players
will work out who has won/lost.

Version 2
All the functionality of above.
But now the game works out if anyone has won or lost. And ends the game
if so.
It still assumes people will not overwrite a square.

Version 3
All the functionaity of above.
But it will stop people overwriting the square.

I broke the speak into three versions (see above). And focused on solving them
the simplest way possible. Trying not to over commit on design structures,
and adding marking points (the versions) to reflect and adapt my design. Identify other paths.
